        <span class="songtitle"> Song for the Open Road </span> <br>
<br> <br>
<span class="songtitle">Robin</span> <br>
<br>
	Wake up Robin now don’t feel blue <br>
	I won’t be leaving here without you <br> 
	And come on Robin now don’t be scared <br>
	We’ll make it, forget how worse they faired <br>
<br>
	And then, when it’s not worth it <br>
	He’ll come back for more <br>
	And he’ll say… <br>
<br>
	Think of how the bluebird sings <br>
	He don’t care that they clipped his wings <br>
	If you just stand proud you’ll rise above <br>
	But if you let them in they’ll trap you like a dove <br>
<br>
	And then, when it’s all over <br>
	You’ll stand in for her <br>
	If she’d said… <br>
<br> <br>
<span class="songtitle">The Merchant </span><br>
<br>
	Tour the penny fare, my son<br>
	Taunt the merchant, anyone<br>
	Well I’ve seen pigments<br>
	From every state along that golden beach<br>
	And yours ain’t nothin special,<br>
	The glint is dead, the hue is weak<br>
	The hue is weak<br>
    <br>
	Now come and listen close, my son<br>
	Tales and fortunes for everyone<br>
	I’ve seen your death, boy<br>
	I see your ghost behind you as we speak<br>
	But you can stop him dead, son<br>
	A simple fee, and you’ll be free<br>
	You’ll be free<br>
    <br>
	Take away the pain, my<br>
	Faults for any gain, I want to<br>
	Realize the kind of life I want to live<br>
    <br>
	Well, you remind me of myself<br>
	Friends and family left on the shelf<br>
	Then I met a merchant<br>
	From far away who sold answers for a fee<br>
	He leaned in close and told me<br>
	Tell me what you need, and you’ll be free<br>
	You’ll be free<br>
    <br>
	Take away the pain, my<br>
	Faults for any gain, I want to<br>
	Realize the kind of life I want to live<br>
    <br>
	I once was a drifter like you, you know<br>
	I’d fight a lot and ask who lives<br>
	A kind of life that leaves you searching for a sign<br>
	And then I went to school<br>
	And I was told it’s all by design<br>
	And if you ask me, that’s shit<br>
	They’ll only feed you lies<br>
    <br>
	After all I’ve said and done<br>
	Wouldn’t it be silly, son?<br>
	To follow the advice of a man<br>
	Who would first sell his soul<br>
	Than to stand on his land?<br>
    <br><br>
	<span class="songtitle">It Has To Be</span><br><br>
<br>
<span class="songtitle">Runaway</span><br>
<br>
	Runaway car on a southbound train<br>
	If you leave me now you won’t see me again<br>
	I’m taking time to live out my life<br>
	A little each day to keep me alive<br>
    <br>
	There something more than all you could give<br>
	A memory of lives once lived<br>
	Lives where we had no regrets<br>
	Just come with me, we’ll try to forget<br>
    <br>
	Let’s leave this tired world behind<br>
	Start walking past the end of the line<br>
	Start moving toward the things we feel inside<br>
    <br>
	Just close your eyes and jump on three<br>
	You’ll realize, just wait and see<br>
	How simple, all our lives, they used to be<br>
    <br>
	Just come with me, we’ll<br>
	Run away from everything<br>
	It’s simpler on the road, you’ll see<br>
	It’s all just one big opportunity<br>
	Just come with me, it’s<br>
	All supposed to be done soon<br>
	We’ll rear our heads in May or June<br>
	We’ll face these problems both, just me and you<br>
    <br>
	I know you’ve locked away your pain<br>
	You don’t rock the boat, you stay in your lane<br>
	To me that sounds like something needs to change<br>
    <br>
	There’s a world outside those open doors<br>
	If you just say its mine and yours<br>
	Its only there if you’ve searched for it before<br>
    <br>
	But sometimes it’s not<br>
	Simple as that<br>
	I know that you can’t just leave<br>
	Tell me that I’m not moving too fast<br>
	Or tell me to wait and I’ll wait<br>
	But I’ll say until then...<br>
    <br>
	If you<br>
	Just come with me, we’ll<br>
	Run away from everything<br>
	It’s simpler on the road, you’ll see<br>
	It’s all just one big opportunity<br>
	Just come with me, it’s<br>
	All supposed to be done soon<br>
	We’ll rear our heads in May or June<br>
	We’ll face these problems both, just me and you<br>
    <br>
<br>
<span class="songtitle">Petrichor</span><br><br>

	Dance like a firefly<br>
	In the fading sun<br>
	Hush, there’s no need to cry.<br>
	You have all but won<br>
	This dreary heart<br>
    <br>
	Eyes like the ocean sun<br>
	Over hills of blue<br>
	There, that’s the starting gun<br>
	I’ll take it for me and you<br>
    <br>
	Come, while we’ve still got the sun<br>
	Oh, there ain’t no need to run<br>
	‘Cause effortlessly, we’ll find<br>
	Everything<br>
	Ain’t what it seems<br>
	And as for the sun<br>
    <br>
	If timeless, as time goes on<br>
	Seems longer than good,<br>
	Then maybe with each new dawn<br>
	We say to one another what we always wish we could<br>
    <br>
	Gold as the setting sun<br>
	In autumn’s peak<br>
	I just need someone<br>
	To hold me when I’m weak<br><br>

	Come, while we’ve still got the sun<br>
	Oh, there ain’t no need to run<br>
	‘Cause effortlessly, we’ll find<br>
	Everything<br>
	Ain’t what it seems<br>
	The rain’s coming down<br><br><br>

	<span class="songtitle">8th Ave</span><br>
<br>
	There’s nothing left to say<br>
	Warm nights under the shutters<br>
	You can’t keep me here forever<br>
	But I want you to stay<br>
	Warm without my number<br>
	Promise me, say more<br>
	About people you’ve met since when we were together<br>
    <br>
	And I’ll miss you <br>
    But I’ll miss me more<br>
    <br>
	I came here with nothing to return<br>
	I only have the lessons I’ve learned<br>
	If you came here for truth but you don’t want it<br>
	Then there’s nothing left to say<br>
	There’s nothing left to say<br>
	There’s nothing left to say<br>
	There won’t be a simpler way<br>
    <br>
	I know a place<br>
	Down avenue eight<br>
	Where they’ll give you a story for free<br>
	It’ll be more concise<br>
	More charming and nice<br>
	More knowing than I’ll ever be<br>
    <br>
	And I know it’s not what you deserve<br>
	But it hurts less when you know for sure<br>
	That everyone got what they came for<br>
    <br>
	Well I’ll miss you<br>
	But I’ll miss me more<br>
    <br><br>
	<span class="songtitle">Lullaby for a Restless Mind</span><br><br><br>

	<span class="songtitle">With Soul Set Free</span><br>
<br>
	If ever I told you I never would go, then I<br>
	Wandered in silence, my fortunes in tow, I can<br>
	Tell you for certain<br>
	Your memory ain’t workin<br>
	<br>
	But it isn’t your fault, it was long before then, that I<br>
	Knew it was time for me to go where it began so I can’t <br>
	Listen to you now<br>
	I’m so sick of this town <br><br><br>

	<span class="songtitle">September on the Mississippi</span><br><br><br>

	<span class="songtitle">Icicle Leaves</span><br>
<br>
	Icicle leaves reaching for ground,<br>
	As the sun looks down from the cloud<br>
	Bicycle wheels will turn around<br>
	Just as sure as the meadow will go brown<br>
    <br>
	Then, say the leaves, singing high in the sunlight,<br>
	Where are you ought to go?<br>
	No, to you.<br>
    <br>
	Why must the leaves fall to the ground<br>
	Bringing with them the color and life<br>
	Then the wind will pick up, whistle and howl,<br>
	Cutting through like dagger and knife<br>
    <br>
	Specter and seed breaking ground in the moonlight,<br>
	Will any call for you?<br>
	None, for you.<br>
    <br>
	When it comes to the end, the end of it all<br>
	Will you plead, will you struggle, for your life?<br>
	Or will you go on, happier now<br>
	To be free of the quarrel and strife?<br>
    <br>
	The air will grow thin, as you fly to the spotlight,<br>
	Who is to choose who will go?<br>
	No, not you.<br>
    <br><br>
	<span class="songtitle">Ramsey Park</span><br>
<br>
	If you turn your pockets out<br>
	Onto a bench in Ramsey park<br>
	They’ll shake you upside down and throw you to the ground<br>
	All for the talk<br>
    <br>
	If I board a Greyhound<br>
	Though momma said don’t come back<br>
	I’ll feel better Chicago-bound<br>
	Can’t feel worse, so thanks for that<br>
    <br>
	You said just one more morning, then I’m free<br>
    <br>
	I remember driving this road, was it 20 years ago?<br>
	When you walk those beams you <br>look straight ahead unless your lunch you throw<br>
	When up there, you’re like<br>
	some kind of bird<br>
	You fly until you dive<br>
	Into conversations teetered on the <br>
	World in view<br>
    <br>
	I kept my eyes forward but the lanes they did collapse on me<br>
	With no other choice, I hit the breaks, I was too blind to see<br>
	The cars all speeding by<br>
	I was too frightened to breathe or cry.<br>
	But I saw<br>
	At the edge of our lives, something needs to go<br>
    <br>
	You said it all<br>
	You wanted nothing more, ooh<br>
	But what does it matter<br>
	If you never loved me too?<br>
    <br>
	You said don’t worry, don’t wait on me.<br><br><br>

	<span class="songtitle">Énouement</span><br>
<br>
	My earliest memory<br>
	Is staring at an apple tree<br>
	Mesmerized by moving bark,<br>
	Cicadas screaming, after dark<br>
    <br>
	My mother calls me in and says<br>
	It’s Christmas Eve, now get to bed<br>
	I cuddle up beneath the hearth<br>
	Rustle in the bag, so tromps my heart<br>
    <br>
	Through snow piles seven meters tall<br>
	We dig and burrow, slip and fall<br>
	Into jagged rocks, into pillow fluff<br>
	Our hands into our pockets stuffed<br>
    <br>
	We hold on to each memory<br>
	They intertwine like symphonies<br>
	Of alpine and serotinous groves<br>
	We burn our thumbs and stub our toes<br>
    <br>
	For ev’ry moment far and gone<br>
	Even the bad, we soon will long<br>
	For simple times are naught but leaves<br>
	Digested from afar with ease<br>
    <br>
	I just wish I could tell myself<br>
	That future knowledge isn’t wealth<br>
	To cherish knowing nothing true<br>
	And knowing just what you should do.<br><br><br>

	<span class="songtitle">Two Realities</span><br>
<br>
I can’t get a move on<br>
I can’t release my spring<br>
I don’t know the answer<br>
Much less anything<br>
<br>
I don’t recognize me<br>
I think I’ve lost my way<br>
Between two realities<br>
Is where I’m stuck today<br><br>

I can’t get no work done<br>
I ain’t got the time<br>
I’m too busy waiting<br>
For that clock to chime<br>
<br>
Tomorrow I’ll wake up early<br>
Today is just a waste<br>
Between two realities<br>
Is where I’m stuck today<br>
<br>
I can’t tell the distance<br>
The back of my head and my eyes share no existence<br>
I don’t see no difference<br>
From being trapped inside and <br> living on the outside looking in<br>
<br>
My arms, they aren’t my own, now<br>
To me they don’t belong<br>
My body to my legs is<br>
Just a thing to pull along<br>
<br>
Long as I keep singing<br>
I think I’ll be okay<br>
Between two realities<br>
Is where I’m stuck today<br>
<br>
I can’t tell the distance<br>
The back of my head and my eyes share no existence<br>
I don’t see no difference<br>
From being trapped inside and <br>living on the outside looking in<br>
<br>
I don’t know the ending<br>
I can’t say for sure<br>
I just hope its peaceful<br>
That I’m old as dirt<br>
<br>
It could be any minute<br>
But put those thoughts away<br>
Between two realities<br>
Is where I’m stuck today<br>
Between two realities<br>
Can’t get unstuck today <br>
